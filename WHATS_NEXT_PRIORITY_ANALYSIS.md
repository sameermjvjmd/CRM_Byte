## 🔴 **MOST IMPORTANT NEXT (Priority Order)**

### **#1: Test PDF/Excel Exports** ⭐ **CRITICAL**
**Why**: Code is complete but untested  
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Impact**: High - Users need this feature  
**Risk**: May have bugs we haven't discovered  

**Action**:
1. Start servers
2. Get fresh JWT token
3. Test all 8 export endpoints
4. Verify PDF and Excel formatting
5. Fix any bugs found

**Why This First**: You can't ship untested code. This needs validation before moving on.
